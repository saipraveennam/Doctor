📝 Project Description: DocSpot is a modern web-based appointment booking platform developed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers. The application supports patients, doctors, and administrators with a smooth interface for scheduling, managing, and tracking appointments securely and efficiently.

Designed to reflect real-world hospital workflows, this scenario-based project ensures practical usability and real-time operation, including doctor filtering, admin approvals, and live status tracking.

🌟 Key Features (Scenario-Based Case Study): 👤 1. User Registration Lavanya, a user, visits DocSpot to consult a doctor. She signs up securely with an email and password.

🔍 2. Browsing and Filtering Doctors After logging in, she views a list of available doctors and filters them by specialization and city.

📅 3. Booking an Appointment She selects a doctor, picks a date, and uploads any documents. A confirmation shows the appointment was requested successfully.

✅ 4. Appointment Confirmation The selected doctor reviews and approves the request. Lavanya receives a notification with the appointment schedule.

🧾 5. Appointment Management Users can cancel or reschedule appointments. They can also track appointment statuses directly in their dashboard.

Approve or reject doctor profiles

Monitor system-wide activity

Ensure secure and policy-compliant usage
